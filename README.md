# Introduction of project
This project allows me to leverage R to determine the optimal number of call centre agents at different scenarios. The optimization model produces ideal (continuous) staffing levels that may include decimals. Rounding down can result in insufficient staffing, leading to unmet call demands, while rounding up may increase operating costs. Therefore, additional analysis is required to evaluate the cost-service trade-offs and determine the most practical hiring strategy.

Please note that the number of agents must be an integer in practice.

# My role

Since this is a group project, everyone gives the equal committment to the completion of tasks. I was assigned on the first scenario includes the initial two questions. Please see the first R script attached in this repo.
