Tesla-Project-Optimization-of-Support-Staffing
This project allows me to leverage R to determine the optimal number of call centre agents at different scenarios. 

The optimization model produces ideal (continuous) staffing levels that may include decimals. Rounding down can result in insufficient staffing, leading to unmet call demands, while rounding up may increase operating costs. Therefore, additional analysis is required to evaluate the cost-service trade-offs and determine the most practical hiring strategy.
